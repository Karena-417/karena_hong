<!-- Add your About -->
I am __Karena Hong__, a Research Analyst and Project Manager from Beacon Consulting Pte Ltd. <br> <br>
Recently, I have completed my Business and Data Analytics programme with Boston Consulting Group (BCG RISE from March-September 2022) concurrently with Data Science & Analytics for Strategic Decisions course with Singapore Management University (SMU from June-August 2022). <br> <br> 
In my 8 years of corporate experience, I have demonstrated the dynamic and resilient side of myself while managing projects in corporate and government entities, achieving my KPI. As a team player, I endeavour to inject spontaneity to my team and aspire to learn from the industry leaders. The moral compass that I continue to uphold throughout these years - Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching. <br> <br>
As a strong believer of lifelong learning, I love staying relevant with the industry trend and acquire essential skillsets, staying on top of the game with the likeminded professions. <br> <br>
Definitely keen to share my Research Analysis and Project Management journey with you. <br>  
Yes, coffee on me!  <br> <br>
